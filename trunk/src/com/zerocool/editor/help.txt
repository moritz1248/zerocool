Help, you want help?

fine...

If you are completely idiotic and don't understand how to use this program, go to 1.

If you are slightly idiotic and have broken the program, go to 2



>>1<<		Use the mouse.  If you don't have a mouse, visit your nearest petstore.  If you don't have a petstore anywhere near you go to 3. If you are still confused go to 4.


>>2<<		E-mail me at sanford@calpoly.edu with any problems you may have, unless those problems consist of; not being able to view help file and/or not being able to hold numbers larger than 3 in your head for more than 3 seconds. If those are your problems... go to 1


>>3<<		If you had a mouse you could surf the web and find a mouse.  But you don't so you can't.  Your like a granny who has lost her glasses and can't find them and will only ever find them if she; steps on them (go to 5), or has them on (go to 6).


>>4<<		The program has a fully functional menu.  All the functions are in the menu.  One might say that the menu contains the functionality.  Also there are some buttons and the mouse does a lot of cool things.  Try it.  go to 42.


>>5<<		Eating mouses is bad for your health.  go to 42.


>>6<<		Stupidity reigns.  go to 42.






>>42<<		Well, that's the answer to pretty much everything so if it isn't working just tell it to fortytwo and maybe it will start behavin'.
